<h1>Silos</h1>

<Transform scale="0.9">

A [silo](https://indieweb.org/silo), or web content hosting silo (AKA walled garden) is a centralized web site (like most social media).

- require you to create an account specific to that site to use it (silo identity)
- allow you to interact on the site only with others with accounts on the site (silo contacts / social network)
- allows you to post some type of content (text, hypertext, images, video)
- and typically one or more of the following:
  - an access wall that prevents indexing of (at least some of the) content you contribute
  - a restrictive terms of service (TOS)
  - claims some ownership or license to any content you create within the silo
  - restricts your ability to import/export your content, or content about your content (e.g. comments, tags)

In business terms, an acquihire is an act/instance of one company (typically a silo) buying out another company primarily for the skills and expertise of its staff rather than for the products or services it supplies.

When platforms die, there is inevitably community loss as the userbase fragments. Some people move to the same platforms but never manage to reconnect. Others migrate to different services that don’t interoperate. Some vanish entirely. Each shift requires rebuilding, and the process of finding the people you once knew and the communities you once valued is laborious. Each shift takes its toll, and everyone has a limit of how much energy they’re willing to expend on a new platform that will eventually, like its predecessors, join the graveyard of defunct websites. And with the shift, old posts and conversations are lost to abandoned accounts or, eventually, server shutdowns.

content silos

Our online content and identities are becoming more important and sometimes even critical to our lives. Neither are secure in the hands of random ephemeral startups or big silos. We should be the holders of our online presence.
