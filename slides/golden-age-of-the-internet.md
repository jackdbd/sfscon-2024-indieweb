<h1>🌟 The Golden Age of the Internet</h1>

<Transform scale="0.9">

The web today is much more <span class="color:accent">centralized</span> than it was in the past.

    I miss when the internet felt like an <span class="color:accent">endless ocean</span> full of passion and creativity. It's now full of corporations, tribalism and people who seek to earn money/push their political views.

The web today is much more <span class="color:accent">homogenous</span> than it was in the past.

    Even in the days of MySpace, users enjoyed a level of <span class="color:accent">control</span> over their personal pages not seen today, with the ability to change the CSS and background image to their liking. Unfortunately, those times are largely behind us now—lost somewhere in the mid-2000s.<br>
    In the Facebook era, everybody shares the same sterile profile, with the only avenues for <span class="color:accent">self-expression</span> being the photos and comments that they post.

I don't particularly like the term "Golden Age" because I find it vague. I much
prefer "The age of forums" or "The age of the decentralized internet".

## I Miss Forums (And the Decentralized Internet)

The channel is by OsakaSyndrome. The quote is from a comment.

In the age of forums we had:

- niche communities in forums
- everyone's experience was different
- forums of 50 people
- less groupthink, more individual thought

- now we have doomscrolling, brainrot

If you are using Discord for async communication, why? Forums are way better for that.

Discord is terrible for many reasons: bad archival capabilities, difficult to search and categorise, not accessible through Google.

Luckily, the programming communities that I like the most (Clojure and Zig) are big on forums.

Discord is a chatting tool for **instant** messaging, not for **async** communication. It was created as a gaming chat. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord

Common themes among these periods include:

A sense of community and openness, with fewer restrictions and more diverse online content
The rise of social media platforms, e-commerce, online education, and other industries that transformed the way people lived and worked.

A perceived lack of commercialization and data exploitation, with fewer large corporations dominating the online landscape.
I remember most (if not all?) courses on Coursera were free in 2013.
Some argue that the internet’s “Golden Age” has already passed, citing issues such as:

- The homogenization of online content and the rise of social media echo chambers
- The exploitation of personal data for advertising and the consolidation of power among large tech companies
- The decline of online communities and the rise of toxicity and harassment

People owned their own domains, crafted personal websites, and connected directly without intermediaries.
