    A personal domain name is an inexpensive, internationally <strong class="color:accent">universal identifier</strong> which gives you more control over your space than other IDs (e.g. email address or phone number.)

Why not just a <strong class="color:accent">subdomain</strong>?

    A subdomain (like <code>example.wordpress.com</code> or <code>example.github.io</code>) <strong class="color:accent">is not something you own</strong>, rather you are at the mercy of the corporation that owns the actual domain name, who thus has ownership and control of all subdomains as well.

<!--
A personal domain is a domain name that you personally own, control, and use to represent yourself on the internet. Getting a personal domain is the first step towards getting on the indieweb, and is therefore a requirement for [IndieMark](https://indieweb.org/IndieMark) Level 0.

## A note on WHOIS and domain privacy

Only use domain privacy if you fully trust the provider of the service -- disputes about domain name administration or transfers may get tricky if you are not listed as the legal owner of the domain.

## 💡 Tip

You should be able to set up all record types (A, CNAME, MX, TXT) for as many subdomains as you'd like/need.

## ❓ FAQ

What if I have to restructure my site and my content end up at different URLs?

What if I need to migrate my content from one domain to another? Or if I have to restructure my site and my content end up at different URLs?

Use HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently) redirects or rewrites. For example, on [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits/#redirects) you can write a `_redirects` file or define [transform rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/).

## 📌 Ideas

It could be interesting if schools taught domain names in web class. Such a class would cover:

- What is a domain name?
- What are the main parts of a domain name?
- Why were they invented?
- What is a URL? What are the parts of a URL?
- What is www? Is it always necessary to add www. to a domain.
- Why might one need a domain name?
