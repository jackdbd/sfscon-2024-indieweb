<Transform scale="0.9">

1. Publish (on your) Own Site â†’ Your site has the original post (i.e. the canonical URL)
1. Syndicate Elsewhere â†’ [syndication targets](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#syndication-targets) (e.g. social networks) get a copy of your post

    By posting first on your own site, you create a direct ownership chain that can be traced back to you without any intervening 3rd party services (silos) TOS's getting in the way.

- Your <span class="color:accent">micropub endpoint</span> should list all the syndication targets you want to send your post to.
- Your <span class="color:accent">micropub client</span> should have a way to publish to the syndication targets. For example, for posting on LinkedIn you will need to create a [LinkedIn OAuth app](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new).

As you can read in <Anchor href="https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit/issues/581" text="Rethinking syndication #581" />, implementing syndication is not trivial.

According to Google, the canonical link element is not considered to be a directive, but rather a hint that the ranking algorithm will "honor strongly".

Canonicalization is the process of selecting the representative â€“canonicalâ€“ URL of a piece of content. Consequently, a canonical URL is the URL of a page that Google chose as the most representative from a set of duplicate pages. Often called deduplication, this process helps Google show only one version of the otherwise duplicate content in its search results.
