# h-card

Update your index.html home page to include your basic information in an h-card. This h-card can be as simple as your name.

Why? When you publish content, you can link back to your home page using rel-author and your authorship information can be retrieved from the h-card.

Advantages: While you are not yet publishing content on your own site, at this point you have:

Staked your claim on the indieweb
Set up an identity that you own and control
Why add my basic contact information in an h-card?

This helps with providing authorship information for anything you publish and link back to your home page with rel-author.
