Avoid content silos

Your content has value to you.

https://indieweb.org/own_your_data

https://indieweb.org/data_portability

own your data is an IndieWeb principle with two key parts:

1. your data lives primarily under your own domain, and
2. you are able to retain your access over time.

Also, can you post anything you want? Can you follow anyone you want? E.g. you cannot Facebook-friend someone who is on Twitter.

When you publish of copy of your content on a silo website (e.g. social network), that copy is also called "POSSE copy".
