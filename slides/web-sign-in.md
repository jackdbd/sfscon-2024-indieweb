<h1>Web Sign-in</h1>

<Transform scale="0.9">

You can sign in to websites using your domain name. This <span class="color:accent">mechanism</span> is called <Anchor href="https://indieweb.org/Web_sign-in" text="Web sign-in" />

Web sign-in can be implemented using these <span class="color:accent">authentication protocols</span>:

- RelMeAuth
- IndieAuth

<br>

Here is how it works:

1. A website presents a login form to the user
2. The user enters their personal domain name into the login form
3. The website verifies that the user has control of that domain (e.g. via RelMeAuth or IndieAuth)
