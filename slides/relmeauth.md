# RelMeAuth

https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth

RelMeAuth is a way to identify yourself as your domain name while using third party OAuth providers to authenticate.

RelMeAuth is a proposed open standard for using rel-me links to profiles on OAuth supporting services to authenticate via either those profiles or your own site.

Why? This ensures that it is easy to see that your profile on the social networks are all the same person as your domain name. This will also allow you to sign in to sites that support IndieAuth â€” like this wiki!

Sites that support both rel-me and are also OAuth providers:
