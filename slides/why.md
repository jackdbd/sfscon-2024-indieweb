Even in the days of MySpace, users enjoyed a level of <strong class="color:accent">control</strong> over their personal pages not seen today, with the ability to change the CSS and background image to their liking. Unfortunately, those times are largely behind us nowâ€”lost somewhere in the mid-2000s.<br>
In the Facebook era, everybody shares the same sterile profile, with the only avenues for <strong class="color:accent">self-expression</strong> being the photos and comments that they post.

If you decide to quit social media, consider [writing a public statement about your decision](https://indieweb.org/silo-quits).

https://indieweb.org/why

In business terms, an acquihire is an act/instance of one company (typically a silo) buying out another company primarily for the skills and expertise of its staff rather than for the products or services it supplies.

https://indieweb.org/silo

A silo or web content hosting silo (AKA walled garden), in the context of the IndieWeb, is a centralized web site (like most social media) typically owned by a for-profit corporation that stakes some claim to content contributed to it and restricts access in some way (has walls).

Silos are characterized by the following:

require you to create an account specific to that site to use it (silo identity)
allow you to interact on the site only with others with accounts on the site (silo contacts / social network)
allows you to post some type of content (text, hypertext, images, video)
and typically one or more of the following:
an access wall that prevents indexing of (at least some of the) content you contribute
a restrictive terms of service (TOS)
claims some ownership or license to any content you create within the silo
restricts your ability to import/export your content, or content about your content (e.g. comments, tags)
