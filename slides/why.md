    I miss when the internet felt like an endless ocean full of passion and creativity. It's now full of corporations, tribalism and people who seek to earn money/push their political views.

    Even in the days of MySpace, users enjoyed a level of <strong class="color:accent">control</strong> over their personal pages not seen today, with the ability to change the CSS and background image to their liking. Unfortunately, those times are largely behind us now—lost somewhere in the mid-2000s.<br>
    In the Facebook era, everybody shares the same sterile profile, with the only avenues for <strong class="color:accent">self-expression</strong> being the photos and comments that they post.

## I Miss Forums (And the Decentralized Internet)

The channel is by OsakaSyndrome. The quote is from a comment.

- niche communities in forums
- everyone's experience was different
- forums of 50 people
- less groupthink, more individual thought

- now we have doomscrolling, brainrot
- if you are using Slack or Discord for communication. Why? Forums are better.

There are many reasons why you should use the IndieWeb, from controlling your experience on the web (instead of corporate algorithms), to deciding where and when to post your content and where it goes.
Perhaps you're done with others owning your content, your identity, and your self.

Common themes among these periods include:

A sense of community and openness, with fewer restrictions and more diverse online content
The rise of social media platforms, e-commerce, online education, and other industries that transformed the way people lived and worked
A perceived lack of commercialization and data exploitation, with fewer large corporations dominating the online landscape
However, some argue that the internet’s “Golden Age” has already passed, citing issues such as:

The homogenization of online content and the rise of social media echo chambers
The exploitation of personal data for advertising and the consolidation of power among large tech companies
The decline of online communities and the rise of toxicity and harassment
